It helps investors quickly gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of a company's earnings. A higher PE can often point to strong growth expectations, while a lower one may reflect slower growth, more risk, or undervaluation. What constitutes a \"fair\" PE ratio really depends on the company's future earnings outlook and the risks it faces within its industry.\n\nOur Discounted Cash Flow"
