The couple, who grew up outside this quaint town in Wisconsin’s Fox River Valley, just closed on a 2,400-square-foot split level for $360,000—almost twice the size of the starter home they sold in the San Fernando Valley for more than twice that price.  Utilities, gasoline and dance and piano lessons for their two children are cheaper in Appleton, too.",
