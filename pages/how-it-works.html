      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>StockHome automatically scans the market (S&P 500 list) to identify actionable trading signals for stocks and options. It analyzes technical indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index), moving averages (DMA-50 and DMA-200), and fundamental metrics such as P/E ratio and market capitalization. When the RSI drops below the oversold threshold (30), a Buy signal is generated — indicating potential short-term recovery opportunities. For these cases, StockHome also recommends a cash-secured put option that offers attractive returns. For each Buy signal, the system scans put options expiring within the next 6–7 weeks and evaluates them based on two key metrics:</p>
      <p>Δ (Delta %) — measures how far the strike price is below the current stock price</p>
      <p>💎 (Premium %) — reflects the option income as a percentage of the stock price</p>
      <p>If the combination of delta and premium exceeds a certain threshold (10 % or higher), it suggests that the option offers an attractive balance between risk (distance from strike) and reward (income premium) — making it a strong Buy candidate.</p>

      <h2>Real-Time Updates</h2>
      <p>The site automatically refreshes alerts and metrics at scheduled intervals of 1 hour, keeping your signals timely and consistent without manual updates. Signals accompanied by the latest market news and sentiment insights, giving you context on why a stock might be moving — so you can make informed decisions.</p>
