<b>How It Works</b>
StockHome automatically scans the market to identify actionable trading signals for stocks and options. It analyzes technical indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index), moving averages (DMA-50 and DMA-200), and fundamental metrics such as P/E ratio and market capitalization.
When the RSI drops below the oversold threshold, a Buy signal is generated â€” indicating potential short-term recovery opportunities. For these cases, StockHome also recommends a cash-secured put option that offers attractive returns while managing downside risk. Each put is evaluated using two key metrics:

Î” (Delta %) â€” measures how far the strike price is below the current stock price, showing your downside buffer.

ðŸ’Ž (Premium %) â€” reflects the option income as a percentage of the stock price.

Together, Î” + ðŸ’Ž gives a simple performance score that helps you compare opportunities at a glance. The higher the combined value, the more favorable the risk-reward balance.

All signals are refreshed automatically and accompanied by the latest market news and sentiment insights, giving you context on why a stock might be moving â€” so you can make informed, data-backed decisions.
